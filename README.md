## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zynthera/Hacker_instagrambot.git
cd Hacker_instagrambot
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project directory and populate it with the following variables:
```env
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_instagram_username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_instagram_password
# Optional: Provide your encryption key, or the bot will generate one automatically.
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_encryption_key
ALLOWED_GROUPS=group_id_1,group_id_2
ADMIN_CONTACT=@xploit.ninja
MESSAGE_UPDATE_INTERVAL=3600
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Generate an Encryption Key (Optional)
If you don‚Äôt want the bot to auto-generate an encryption key, you can generate one manually:

#### **Using Python Script**
1. Create the following script in a file named `generate_encryption_key.py`:
   ```python
   from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

   def generate_key(file_name="encryption.key"):
       """
       Generate a secure encryption key and save it to a file.
       """
       key = Fernet.generate_key()
       with open(file_name, "wb") as key_file:
           key_file.write(key)
       print(f"Encryption key successfully generated and saved to '{file_name}'.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       generate_key()
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python generate_encryption_key.py
   ```

3. A file named `encryption.key` will be created in your directory. Open the file, copy the key, and paste it into your `.env` file under `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Bot
Start the bot with:
```bash
python main.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options
The bot can be customized using the `.env` file:
- **`INSTAGRAM_USERNAME`**: Your Instagram username.
- **`INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD`**: Your Instagram password.
- **`ENCRYPTION_KEY`**: A secure encryption key (generated automatically if not provided).
- **`ALLOWED_GROUPS`**: Comma-separated list of group IDs authorized to receive messages.
- **`ADMIN_CONTACT`**: Contact information for the bot admin (e.g., Instagram handle).
- **`MESSAGE_UPDATE_INTERVAL`**: Time interval (in seconds) for updating messages.

## üß™ FAQ

### **1. What happens if I don‚Äôt provide an encryption key?**
The bot will automatically generate a secure encryption key and save it in a file named `encryption.key`.

### **2. How do I find group IDs for `ALLOWED_GROUPS`?**
You can refer to Instagram's API documentation or use third-party tools to fetch group IDs.

### **3. Can this bot run on Termux?**
Yes! Follow these steps to install the required dependencies on Termux:
```bash
pkg update
pkg upgrade
pkg install python rust cargo
pkg install clang python-dev libffi libffi-dev openssl openssl-dev
pip install cryptography
```

### **4. How do I troubleshoot encryption errors?**
Ensure the `cryptography` library is installed:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```
If the issue persists, regenerate the encryption key using the script provided above.

## üí° Best Practices
- **Secure Your `.env` File**: Avoid sharing your `.env` file or storing it in public repositories.
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Set a strong password for your Instagram account.

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
  ```
